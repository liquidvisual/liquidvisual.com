					<p class="lead">Because responsive design is hard, first and foremost. These offshore businesses are dealing with hundreds of clients and the developers aren't being paid enough, so you end up with a dodgy end-product and a lame user experience.</p>

					<p class="capitalise">
					Elaine: He took it out. Kramer: El Paso. I spent a month there, one night! Jerry: Looking at cleavage is like looking at the sun. You don't stare at it. You get a sense of it and you look away. Jerry: I thought you said people dressed up when they go to the opera? Kramer: People do. I don't. Uncle Leo: Jerry, hellooo! Kramer: Your Nana’s missing because she’s been passing those bum checks all over town and she finally pissed off the wrong people. George: My whole life has been a complete waste of time. Jerry: And there's so much more to go!</p>

					<h3>Setting Up The Dev Environment May Take A While</h3>

					<p>Jerry: The whole reason you watch a TV show is because it ends. If I wanted a long, boring story with no point to it, I've got my life. George: Frolf, frisbee golf, Jerry. Golf with a frisbee. George: I'd rather be dating the blind. A good looking blind woman doesn't even know you're not good enough for her. Kramer: Boxers! How do you wear these things? Look at that–they’re bagging up, they’re rising in, and there’s nothing holding me in place. Elaine: I am going to</p>

					<h3>Jekyll Requirements</h3>

					<p> sidle the sidler. Jerry: You sidle? You stomp around like a Clydesdale. Mr. Ross: It's a terrible tragedy when parents outlive their children. George: Yes, I agree. I hope my parents go long before I do. Jerry: Women go after doctors like men go after models. They want someone with knowledge of the body. We just want the body. Jerry: Is it possible they're</p>

					<h4>Opening Up The Docs</h4>

					<p>Just having babies to get people to visit them? George: My father was a quitter, my grandfather was a quitter, I was raised to give up. It's one of the few things I do well. George: You know what I love? How there's two nuts named after people: Hazel and Filbert. Estelle Costanza: You're not giving away our waterpik!, Jerry : I'll tell you what the big advantage of homosexuality is. If you're going out with someone your size, you double your wardrobe.</p>

					<p>Jerry: We were in the garage. You know how garages are. They're conducive to sex talk. It's a high testosterone area. George: You could do your taxes in the time it takes me to have an orgasm.</p>

					<p>George: Was he on his death bed? Jerry: No, he was on his regular bed. Elaine: No, I don't have a square to spare. I can't spare a square."</p>

					<p>George: Jerry! Jerry, I'm trapped under my desk. Steinbrenner's in the room. You gotta help me! Jerry: Who is this. Puddy: Right, Koko. That chimp's alright. High-five. Darren: Hi, this is Darren from Kramer’s office. Mr. Kramer would like to schedule a lunch with you at Monk’s coffee shop. Jerry (about George): When he's dead he'll be relieved. Jerry (about George): When he's dead he'll be relieved. George: This experience has changed me. It’s made me more cynical, more bitter, more jaded. Jerry: Really? George: Sure, why not. Elaine: So you were violated by two people while you were under the gas. Big deal! You're single. Morty Seinfeld: How could you spend $200 on a tip calculator? Uncle Leo: Jerry, hellooo! Tim Whatley: Oh, which reminds me, did you hear the one about the Pope and Raquel Welch on the lifeboat.</p>

			<h3 class="subheader">H3-sb. Well Bond we Meet Again..</h3>

			<ul class="medium-block-grid-2 smaller-text">
				<li>
					<h4 class="subheader">H4. Quality Consulting</h4>
					<p>Project managers often use me as their go-to consultant for anything web related. This is free - I don't charge for emails. My communication is concise, well thought out and clear. If there's something I'm unsure of, I'll research it and actually get back to you.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4 class="subheader">H4. PSD to Responsive Builds</h4>
					<p>I help agencies build websites from a single PSD - often the product of a crowd sourcing website like 99 designs or Crowdspring. With the advantage of a previous design background I'm able to interpret a single static homepage and create a complete styleguide with multiple consistent inner pages that are all responsive.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4 class="subheader">H4. Client Communication</h4>
					<p>I help project managers communicate with their clients on technical concerns through clear, well argued emails and ad-hoc demos. I realise in most cases that emails from you are originally words from the client, so I write everything with that in mind so you can reuse my words directly.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4 class="subheader">H4. The Designer Goes M.I.A</h4>
					<p>Often I'll receive graphics that are photocopied, low resolution, or the designer is M.I.A. These could be logos, infographics or various other bits and bobs that aren't usable in their current state. Rather than hiring a new designer, I can rebuild those graphics (or template files) and make them responsive to boot.</p>
